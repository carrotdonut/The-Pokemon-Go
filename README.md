# The-Pokemon-Go
A web application with touchscreen buttons that wirelessly controls a Pokemon-themed Parallax Boe-Bot Robot using a Raspberry Pi.
This was my final project for my Grade 12 Computer Engineering Course.

I used WebIOPi to create the web application so that it can wirelessly communicate with the Raspberry Pi. The buttons on the
application would then call the corresponding python script that controls the servo motors of the Boe-Bot. 

NOTE: This project was completed in January, 2017. I am just uploading all the code files now.

The Boe-Bot unfortunately belongs to the school so I was forced to take my project apart :(
